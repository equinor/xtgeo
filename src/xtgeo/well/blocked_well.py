# CLASS


class BlockedWell(Well):
    """Class for a blocked well in the XTGeo framework, subclassed from the
    Well class.

    Similar to Wells, the blocked well logs are stored as Pandas dataframe,
    which make manipulation easy and fast.

    For blocked well logs, the numbers of rows cannot be changed if you want to
    save the result in RMS, as this is derived from the grid. Also the blocked well
    icon must exist before save.

    The well trajectory are here represented as logs, and XYZ have magic names:
    X_UTME, Y_UTMN, Z_TVDSS, which are the three first Pandas columns.

    Other geometry logs has also 'semi-magic' names:

    M_MDEPTH or Q_MDEPTH: Measured depth, either real/true (M...) or
    quasi computed/estimated (Q...). The Quasi may be incorrect for
    all uses, but sufficient for some computations.

    Similar for M_INCL, Q_INCL, M_AZI, Q_ASI.

    I_INDEX, J_INDEX, K_INDEX: They are grid indices. For practical reasons
    they are treated as a CONT logs, since the min/max grid indices usually are
    unknown, and hence making a code index is not trivial.

    All Pandas values (yes, discrete also!) are stored as float64
    format, and undefined values are Nan. Integers are stored as Float due
    to the lacking support for 'Integer Nan' (currently lacking in Pandas,
    but may come in later Pandas versions).

    Note there is a method that can return a dataframe (copy) with Integer
    and Float columns, see :meth:`get_filled_dataframe`.

    The instance can be made either from file or::

        >>> well1 = BlockedWell(well_dir + '/OP_1.bw')  # assume RMS ascii well
        >>> well2 = BlockedWell(well_dir + '/OP_1.bw', fformat='rms_ascii')
        >>> well3 = xtgeo.blockedwell_from_file(well_dir + '/OP_1.bw')

    If in RMS, instance can be made also from RMS icon::

        well4 = xtgeo.blockedwell_from_roxar(
            project,
            'gridname',
            'bwname',
            'wellname',
        )

    For arguments, see method under :meth:`from_file`.
